SSH-KEYSIGN(8)              System Manager's Manual             SSH-KEYSIGN(8)

NAME
     ssh-keysign - ssh helper program for hostbased authentication

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-keysign

DESCRIPTION
     ssh-keysign is used by ssh(1) to access the local host keys and generate
     the digital signature required during hostbased authentication with SSH
     protocol version 2.  ssh-keysign is not intended to be invoked by the
     user, but from ssh(1).  See ssh(1) and sshd(8) for more information about
     hostbased authentication.

FILES
     /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
             These files contain the private parts of the host keys used to
             generate the digital signature.  They should be owned by root,
             readable only by root, and not accessible to others.  Since they
             are readable only by root, ssh-keysign must be set-uid root if
             hostbased authentication is used.
