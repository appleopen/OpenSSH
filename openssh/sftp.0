SFTP(1)                     System Reference Manual                    SFTP(1)

NAME
     sftp - Secure file transfer program

SYNOPSIS
     sftp [-vC] [-b batchfile] [-o ssh_option] [host]
     sftp [[user@]host[:file [file]]]
     sftp [[user@]host[:dir[/]]]

DESCRIPTION
     sftp is an interactive file transfer program, similar to ftp(1),  which
     performs all operations over an encrypted ssh(1) transport.  It may also
     use many features of ssh, such as public key authentication and compresM--
     sion.  sftp connects and logs into the specified hostname, then enters an
     interactive command mode.

     The second usage format will fetch files automaticly if a non-interactive
     authentication is used, else it do so after an interactive authentication
     is used.

     The last usage format allows the sftp client to start in a remote direcM--
     tory.

     The options are as follows:

     -b batchfile
             Batch mode reads a series of commands from an input batchfile inM--
             stead of stdin. Since it lacks user interaction it should be used
             in conjunction with non-interactive authentication.  sftp will
             abort if any of the following commands fail: get, put, rename,
             ln, rm and lmkdir.

     -C      Enables compression (via ssh's -C flag)

     -o ssh_option
             Specify an option to be directly passed to ssh(1).

     -v      Raise logging level. This option is also passed to ssh.

INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
     Once in interactive mode, sftp understands a set of commands similar to
     those of ftp(1).  Commands are case insensitive and pathnames may be enM--
     closed in quotes if they contain spaces.

     cd path
             Change remote directory to path.

     lcd path
             Change local directory to path.

     chgrp grp path
             Change group of file path to grp. grp must be a numeric GID.

     chmod mode path
             Change permissions of file path to mode.

     chown own path
             Change owner of file path to own. own must be a numeric UID.

     exit    Quit sftp.

     get [flags] remote-path [local-path]
             Retrieve the remote-path and store it on the local machine.  If
             the local path name is not specified, it is given the same name
             it has on the remote machine. If the -P flag is specified, then
             the file's full permission and access time are copied too.

     help    Display help text.

     lls [ls-options [path]]
             Display local directory listing of either path or current direcM--
             tory if path is not specified.

     lmkdir path
             Create local directory specified by path.

     ln oldpath newpath
             Create a symbolic link from oldpath to newpath.

     lpwd    Print local working directory.

     ls [path]
             Display remote directory listing of either path or current direcM--
             tory if path is not specified.

     lumask umask
             Set local umask to umask.

     mkdir path
             Create remote directory specified by path.

     put [flags] local-path [local-path]
             Upload local-path and store it on the remote machine. If the reM--
             mote path name is not specified, it is given the same name it has
             on the local machine. If the -P flag is specified, then the
             file's full permission and access time are copied too.

     pwd     Display remote working directory.

     quit    Quit sftp.

     rename oldpath newpath
             Rename remote file from oldpath to newpath.

     rmdir path
             Remove remote directory specified by path.

     rm path
             Delete remote file specified by path.

     symlink oldpath newpath
             Create a symbolic link from oldpath to newpath.

     ! command
             Execute command in local shell.

     !       Escape to local shell.

     ?       Synonym for help.
